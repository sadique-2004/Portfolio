Welcome to **Sadique.Dev** – not your regular portfolio, but my digital playground where I show off my **skills, projects, achievements, and journey** as a developer.  

This isn’t built by following a YouTube tutorial step by step – it’s **me + a pinch of AI magic + endless experiments** 🤯.  
People already told me they **love my portfolio ❤️** (and honestly, that’s the best motivation). Some even cloned it, some gave me stars 🌟, some didn’t (ouch 😅)…  

👉 If you love it enough to **use or clone**, that’s totally cool with me – but hey, at least **hit that ⭐ Star button**. It costs nothing, but means everything ✨.
